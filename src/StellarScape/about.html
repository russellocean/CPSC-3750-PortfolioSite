        <p>
          StellarScape is a web application that aims to bring the wonders of
          space exploration closer to you. We leverage NASA's powerful APIs to
          provide you with stunning imagery and insightful data from various
          missions, including the Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) and the
          Mars Rover missions.

          every day, along with a brief explanation written by a professional
          astronomer. The APOD API allows us to fetch and display these
