        Mt. Joy is an American indie rock band formed in Philadelphia,
        Pennsylvania, and based in Los Angeles, California. The band consists of
        Matt Quinn (vocals, guitar), Sam Cooper (guitar), Michael Byrnes (bass),
        Sotiris Eliopoulos (drums), and Jackie Miclau (keyboards). They debuted
        in 2016 with their single "Astrovan" and have since released three
        studio albums: "Mt. Joy", "Rearrange Us", and "Orange Blood".

        Their music blends alternative rock, indie rock, folk rock, blues rock,
        and Americana. The band's journey began with high school friends
        reuniting in Los Angeles, leading to the formation of Mt. Joy. They have
        charted at the top spot of the Billboard Triple A charts with "Silver
        Lining" and embarked on headlining tours across North America and
        Europe, in addition to performing at major festivals.

        Mt. Joy is also known for their activism, contributing to causes such as
        Campaign Zero and serving as ambassadors for the voter registration
        organization, HeadCount. Their story is one of serendipitous reunions,
        rapid streaming success, and a commitment to making music that resonates
        with a broad audience while making a difference.
