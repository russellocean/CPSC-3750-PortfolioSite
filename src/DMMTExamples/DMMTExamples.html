          <h2>MyUS.com - Poor Use of Space and Inconsistent Typography</h2>
          <p>
            Rules Violated: Keep it simple and Create a clear visual hierarchy
          </p>
          <p>
            Description: MyUS.com encounters significant issues with its use of
            whitespace and typography, leading to a cluttered and visually
            unappealing layout. The website packs an abundance of information
            into limited space without proper segmentation, resulting in a
            disorganized appearance. Furthermore, the inconsistent use of font
            sizes and styles throughout the site adds to the confusion,
            detracting from the user's ability to easily digest the content.
            Proper use of heading tags and more structured layout could greatly
            enhance readability and improve the overall user experience.
