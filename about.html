            Hi, I'm Russell Welch, a 21-year-old enthusiast from the sunny
            shores of Charleston, South Carolina. My journey into the world of
            technology began early, running game servers and modding games in
            middle school, which laid the foundation for my passion for coding.
            This passion for creation and innovation led me to Clemson
            University, where I'm pursuing a Bachelor of Computer Science.
          </p>

            class="inline-image"
          />

          <p>
            My education was furthered by a rigorous four-year IT program in
            high school, which concluded with a TestOut PC Pro certification.
            Post-graduation, I had the opportunity to work with CCSD's IT
            department, setting up new networks and performing general IT tasks.
            This hands-on experience was invaluable and solidified my decision
            to delve deeper into the field of technology.
          </p>
          <p>
            The following summer, I started as an IT intern at Goldfinger
            Monitors, but software development was where I saw my future. After
            proving my abilities on a project with the company's POS system, I
            transitioned into the role of a Software Engineer Intern. Remote
            work during the subsequent year allowed me to focus on identifying
            and solving significant issues with our data collection and
            communication systems.
          </p>
          <p>
            My proposals for these systems led to the development of Goldfinger
            MANAGE, a modular application designed to streamline company
            operations. As the Lead Software Engineer, I now oversee the
            continuous development and improvement of this system, ensuring it
            scales with the company's growth.

          <h2>My Path to Software Engineering</h2>
          <p>
            It was during my time at Goldfinger Monitors that I saw the
            potential for significant improvement in our internal processes.
            MANAGE was born out of a need for better data consistency and
            workflow streamlining. From ideation to deployment, I led the
            project, pushing our data management from Excel to a modern web
            application ecosystem.

          <h2>Interests & Hobbies</h2>
          <p>
            When I'm not coding or managing software projects, I love to
            explore, travel, and hike. The ocean is my escape, and surfing is
            how I find balance. These activities not only provide a sense of
            adventure but also inspire creativity in my technical work.
