          <p>
            Since May 2023, I've been working on Goldfinger MANAGE, an internal
            application designed to enhance company-wide data management. This
            system centralizes data related to product development, inventory,
            and manufacturing processes, employing a tech stack that includes
            JavaScript, Electron, React, and Supabase.

          <p>
            From February to July 2023, I developed Aidapt, a VSCode extension
            that serves as an AI-powered coding assistant. Utilizing OpenAI's
            API, it helps to streamline the coding process by providing
            contextual assistance, implemented using JavaScript, React, and
            Supabase.

          <p>
            My research on developing a Carplay/Android Auto compatible car head
            unit for Goldfinger from December 2023 to April 2023 involved
            exploring Swift UI and Android to create a user-friendly interface
            for in-car systems.

          <p>
            From July 2022 to January 2023, I was involved in developing API
            solutions for controlling LED lighting on Goldfinger gaming
            monitors. The project aimed at enhancing the gaming experience
            through interactive light patterns, incorporating C# and Arduino
            technology.

          <p>
            Between May and August 2022, I contributed to the development of a
            POS system for Goldfinger's casino operations. This system, designed
            to streamline customer interactions, involved extensive database
            management and UI development in a Java and Linux environment.

          <p>
            In early 2021, I worked on creating a voxel-based terrain generation
            system in Unreal Engine 4. This project involved implementing
            procedural terrain generation using C++, focusing on efficient data
            structures and rendering techniques.

          <p>
            From June 2017 to September 2019, I dedicated myself to creating
            terrains for Arma 3, utilizing a suite of tools including World
            Creator, Blender, and Arma's modding tools. My notable contributions
            include 'Chernarus Redux,' which amassed over 200,000 downloads, and
            'Cytech Industries,' reaching over 30,000 downloads. In addition to
            these public releases, I also developed several custom terrains for
            private servers and content creators, exploring various aspects of
            simulation and world-building in game development.
