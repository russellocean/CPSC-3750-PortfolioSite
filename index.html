        <h1>I'm Russell, nice to meet you.</h1>
        <p>
          I'm a software engineer and web developer. I'm passionate about
          creating beautiful, functional, and accessible web applications. I'm
          currently a student at Clemson University studying computer science.

           As a dedicated software engineer at Goldfinger Monitors, I specialize in developing React-based internal logistical software that streamlines operations and enhances productivity. My passion for technology extends beyond the professional realm into my personal interests, which include traveling, hiking, exploring new places, and a deep fascination with cars. Currently, I am pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Clemson University, where I am in my junior year with an anticipated graduation in 2025. My journey in technology is just beginning, and I am excited to see where it takes me.
